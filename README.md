# Machine Learning
Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive* amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things—numbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm.

Machine learning is the process that powers many of the services we use today—recommendation systems like those on Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; social-media feeds like Facebook and Twitter; voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. The list goes on.

# Data-Mining
Data Mining refers to the process of examining large data repositories, including databases, data warehouses, Web, document collections, and data streams for the task of automatic discovery of patterns and knowledge from them. This repo covers an introduction to fundamental concepts, data warehousing, data pre-processing, association rules, cluster analysis, classification and prediction, frequent pattern mining, and advanced data mining applications in bioinformatics, computer vision, Web, text, big data, social networks, and computational journalism.
